🎯 Objective
This project demonstrates how to clean and prepare the Iris dataset for machine learning. The steps include data exploration, handling missing values (if any), encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and outlier removal.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python 3

Pandas – For handling and analyzing data

NumPy – For numerical operations

Seaborn / Matplotlib – For data visualization

Scikit-learn – For loading the dataset and preprocessing

📂 Dataset Description
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset that includes 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features:

Sepal length (cm)

Sepal width (cm)

Petal length (cm)

Petal width (cm)

Species (target class with 3 flower types)

The goal is to prepare this dataset for use in machine learning models.

📋 Steps Followed
1. Import Required Libraries
Import essential Python libraries for data handling, visualization, and preprocessing.

2. Load the Dataset
Use scikit-learn's built-in function to load the Iris dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Explore the Data
Display the first few rows, check column names, data types, and basic statistics. This helps understand the structure of the data.

4. Check for Missing Values
Scan the dataset for any missing values. Although the Iris dataset is typically clean, it's good practice to confirm.

5. Encode Categorical Data (if needed)
The target column may be numerical (0, 1, 2), but if it’s in text format (e.g., 'setosa'), convert it to numbers using encoding techniques like label encoding or one-hot encoding.

6. Standardize the Numerical Features
Normalize or standardize the features (sepal/petal length and width) to bring all values to a similar scale, which helps many machine learning models perform better.

7. Detect and Remove Outliers
Use statistical methods (like IQR or boxplots) to visualize and remove outliers that may affect model performance.

✅ Final Output
A clean, standardized dataset with no missing values or outliers.
Ready to be used for training machine learning models like classification algorithms.
